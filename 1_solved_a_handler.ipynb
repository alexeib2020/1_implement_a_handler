    "### How To Implement a Connector/Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation of an integration *must* be done as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    " - data must be requested/returned one page at a time\n",
    " - handlers must respect rate limits and be runnable in a distributed environment\n",
    " - everything must be tested\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's discuss the above via examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One Page At a Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get any further, there are a few terms we use here that you should be familiar with:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `Task` - a task is a request for a page of data-- it is always an object\n",
    " - `Handler` - a handler is a function that executes the `Task` and returns a `TaskResult`\n",
    " - `TaskResult` - an object that returns the page of data we retrieved in the `Handler` -- it is always an object\n",
    "\n",
    "So here's the problem-- some of the data we download is huge-- many, many GBs! Too large to fit into memory.\n",
    "\n",
